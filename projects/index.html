        <h1>Programming Projects</h1>
<hr>
<p>Below you'll find a curated selection of some of my personal programming projects. For a summary of my mathematical research, <a href="../research/">click here</a>.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Turing Machine Simulator</h2>
<p><a href="../turing/">link to live project</a></p>
<h3>Web app built with JavaScript, React</h3>
<p>Turing Machine simulator. Parses source-code written in simple, 
custom language for describing Turing Machines. Displays state 
simulation that users can step through. Provides numerous
examples users can toggle between, with explanations. Allows users to
write their own machines using a custom syntax. Deployed in an
educational setting for teaching introduction to computability theory. 
Responsive design. Progressive web application.</p>

<h2>DLX Multiset Multicover package</h2>
<p><a href="../sudoku/">link to project blog post</a></p>
<h3>Python package implementing efficient combinatorial algorithms</h3>
<p>Fast library for solving combinatorial problems using an 
implementation of Donald Knuth’s DLX algorithm. Includes
module for classic Sudoku and “Chess Sudoku” variants, including
optional adjacency constraints. Was used to obtain the first calculation
of the number of unique solutions to the “Miracle Sudoku” variant. </p>

<h2>Weather Journal</h2>
<p><a href="../weather/">link to project blog post</a></p>
<h3>Native Android application written in Java</h3>
<p>Android application allowing users to keep a journal of local
weather conditions. Native application written in Java. 
Interfaces with file system to export journal notes. 
Interfaces with Android location services
for GPS location. Interfaces with third-party web API to fetch 
weather. Interfaces with SQLite database to store journal 
records. </p>
<hr>
<h2>Pomoduino time-management clock</h2>
<p><a href="../pomoduino/">link to project blog post</a></p>
<h3>A pomodoro clock for Arduino-compatible microcontrollers</h3>
<p>This Pomodoro timer keeps track of your work sessions 
on the liquid-crystal display with a cute, custom tomato glyph. 
After each work period, you'll be notified to take a break 
with a short chime. After you complete four Pomodoros, you'll 
be notified to take a longer break with a longer chime.</p>

<h3>Portfolio website built with Python, Node.js, Pelican</h3>
<p>This website! A responsive personal portfolio and academic 
CV website for presenting content related to programming 
and mathematics. Built with Pelican static website framework. 
Blog features Pygments code-syntax highlighting and LaTeX 
integration with MathJax. Hosts a portfolio of projects and 
technical writings related to programming, theoretical 
computer science, and mathematical logic.</p>
