        <p>I'm reading the 2nd edition of Martin Fowler's <em>Refactoring</em>, here is his description of the "shotgun surgery" code smell:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You whiff this when, every time you make a change, you have to make a lot of little edits to a lot of different classes. When the changes are all over the place, they are hard to find, and it’s easy to miss an important change.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thinking about the process you would have to take to, for example, add a new feature to a web app, "lots of little edits to a lot of different classes" are going to happen for every new feature:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create or edit models for the new entities in the database </li>
<li>Create or edit classes to manage the new entity</li>
<li>Create or edit methods in the new classes for the new functionality</li>
<li>Create or edit schema for serializing/deserializing data from the database</li>
<li>Create or edit schema for serializing/deserializing data for the API</li>
<li>Create or edit API endpoints for the functionality</li>
<li>Create or edit frontend components for the functionality</li>
</ul>
<p>It seems to me that shotgun surgery could arise from violations of the <em>Single responsibility principle</em> (SRP), in that if many individual modules are each serving many actors, then they will all have to change. </p>
<p>This situation is described in the "Divergent Change" code smell:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Divergent change occurs when one module is often changed in different ways for different reasons. If you look at a module and say, “Well, I will have to change these three functions every time I get a new database; I have to change these four functions every time there is a new financial instrument,” this is an indication of divergent change. The database interaction and financial processing problems are separate contexts, and we can make our programming life better by moving such contexts into separate modules.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The single responsibility principle states that each module of source code should serve only one actor. An actor is an abstract personification of sources of change requests or feature requets. Put another way, a module should have only a single reason for change. However, the fact that a single actor is served by many modules does not mean that there is a SRP violation. </p>
<p>Put in table form:
| Actors | Modules | Conditions |
|--------|---------|------------|
| Many | Many | SRP violation, shotgun surgery, divergent change |
| Many | One | SRP violation, divergent change |
| One | Many | shotgun surgery |</p>
<p>It doesn't seem to me that having to change many modules to introduce a feature is actually a problem, as long as all those modules serve only the single actor on whose behalf the change is being made.</p>
<p>Perhaps it's best to think of an application as partitioned into a sort of horizontal and vertical grid. Along the vertical slices, we have actors who produce user stories: payroll, financial instruments, users, etc. These we can identify with <em>aspects</em> of the software. Along the horizontal slices, we have <em>contexts</em>: database models, database access, business objects, APIs, and GUIs. </p>
<p>A single vertical slice will cut across all contexts. A horizontal context change will slice across all aspects. </p>
