        <p>I had been using the phrase "unwritten abstraction" for a while to describe design patterns in Python, or any dynamically typed programming langauge. </p>
<p>Today I googled the phrase to see what other people had to say about it. I found only 1 result, having nothing to do with programming. Perhaps another equivalent phrase has already been coined, but Googling "unwritten interface" similarly provided no results. </p>
<p>What do I mean by "unwritten abstraction"? </p>
<p>In statically typed languages like Java, programmers often use interfaces to attain inversion of control. Rather than relying directly on a concrete implementation, client code can call to a rigid interface, avoiding the need to recompile any client code to make bug fixes to the server code.</p>
<p>This idea of inversion of control is closely tied to interfaces in Java or multiple inheritance in C++. Often, programmers see the resultant inflation of interfaces (something which is also pursued to avoid fat interfaces and the <em>refusal of requests</em> problem) as comical: "Java programmers love to write classes that don't do anything". However, inversion of control is far more ubiquitous than statically compiled langauges, or the class or modules systems of programming languages at all.</p>
<p>Other prominent examples of inversion of control include drivers and operating systems: a printer driver generally shouldn't have to recompile for any changes made to the operating system, instead of the file system driver depending upon the concrete operating system implementation, the driver implements a strandardized file interface so it can receive data. It depends on an abstraction: the file abstraction. Other examples are web API's and client code, etc.</p>
<p>So what about dynamic languages like Python? Python is generally an interpreted language. Although programming styles vary, Python code typically doesn't involve huge class hierarchies. The reason for this is pretty clear: almost all of our function calls are dynamically dispatched. Alan Kay's metaphor for object-oriented programming is "message passing". Objects don't execute the methods of other objects, instead they "pass messages" to other objects, which they can do with as they see fit.</p>
<p>What this means is that in a dynamic languages, interfaces still exist, even if they haven't been written down separately. The collection of functions a class or a module exposes is its interface. You still have the interfaces, they are simply aren't written down anywhere. Your clients will still be relying on an abstraction: the set of messages they can send you i.e. the set of methods you expose.</p>
<p>Knowing how to judiciously manage interfaces is just as important in dynamic langauges, and you still have to maintain your abstractions even if they aren't written down in one place. Every time you add a public method to a class or an outer function to a module, that function can end up being used by other client code, and you are stuck supporting it. Every new use case you invite into a module will bring new actors into your module looking to change the code.</p>
<p>For new Python programmers, the unique nature of dynamic code can make it hard to understand architectural concerns as spelled out in Java or C# textbooks. This can lead to two extremes: developers can embrace everything they have learned about interfaces and try to replicate them in a dynamic language where they make little sense, creating actual interface classes where none are necessary. Or at the other extreme, developers can think all this abstraction stuff is something that doesn't apply to them at all. </p>
<p>It helps to understand instead that dynamic languages still have abstractions and they still have interfaces, they simply aren't written down in separate files. Instead, they are implicitly being defined every time you add an outer function to a module or a public method to a class. </p>
