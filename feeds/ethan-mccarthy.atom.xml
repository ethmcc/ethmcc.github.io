a design feature. I have my own idea of what meaning is 
conveyed by the word, but decided I should probably look up 
modern usage to see what meaning others might take from it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I encountered a lot of arguments, and a lot of concern over 
whether the term was even meaningful. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From Wiki &lt;em&gt;?DefinitionOfHomoiconic&lt;/em&gt; :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is some debate about what exactly consitutes
homoiconicity, and about which languages are 
homoiconic&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately this page does not exist on the current Wiki 
as of September 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Questions of the following type abound on forums, which I paraphrase:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is homoiconicity well-defined? 
Is the word mathematically rigorous? 
Is there a test that can be applied to 
show that Lisp is homoiconic but C isn't?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To approach this question at face value, every definition I've seen attempting 
to apply homoiconicity as a formal
property of a language focuses on "the internal representation of code", 
that is, they are concerned with the &lt;em&gt;implementation&lt;/em&gt;. 
If we were to try to mathematically formalize this, perhaps we could apply 
the definition then to a formal semantics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every approach to formalizing the semantics of C that I have seen certainly 
doesn't take an approach that could be described as homoiconic. 
One would expect that a natural understanding of the semantics of C 
would discuss memory and addresses, rather than something that looks like C expressions. 
Indeed, any language based more on procedures than on expressions, simply does 
not have in mind the concept of homoiconicity as a design feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both K&amp;amp;C and the ANSI C standard themselves are informal (mathematically) natural 
language descriptions, 
whereas the specifications for e.g. SML and Scheme provide formal semantics. 
The Scheme specification, in particular, provide a fairly homoiconic 
formal semantics in terms of mathematical objects that look very much 
directly like Scheme expressions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I doubt that formally rigorous mathematical definitions will actually help 
much here, or provide better meaning or understanding to programmers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, a very practical and meaningful distinction between the code-as-data 
properties of Lisp, versus those of C, can be noticed in the following observation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can write a Scheme interpreter in about 20 lines of Scheme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You'd be hard-pressed to write a C interpreter in less than 20,000 lines of C.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an observation that is directly relevant to a programmer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it would certainly be of mathematical interest to provide some sort of formalism that 
could help mathematicians to study this, the observation is clearly 
meaningful and valid whether or not mathematicians have provided a 
formalism to help explain it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most formal mathematical definitions would not notice a difference between 20 
lines and 20,000 lines, so a completely naive approach would be likely to fail,
although I would not bet the house against there being some more subtle way to 
formally tease out the difference. I would not expect this to work well for C 
itself, because again: C doesn't have a clearly suitable formal semantics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;As a design concept&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The approach of asking whether a language "has homoiconicity", or has not, 
as in some sort of desirable marketing term to attract users, doesn't seem 
particularly fruitful. To my work as a programmer, the concept of homoiconicity 
has been more productively understood as a &lt;em&gt;design concept&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider the design of the UNIX shell: one runs programs in the shell by typing 
commands, but that same sequence of commands can itself be packaged into a program itself 
as a shell script. That is, there is homoiconicity between user interaction 
with programs, and programs themselves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The "everything is a file" principle similarly provides 
&lt;em&gt;uniformity of representation&lt;/em&gt; between numerous other concepts, 
e.g. between devices and device drivers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is then the advantages that homoiconicity can provide which should be weighed: 
extensibility, automatic extension of new features across 
old programs without needing to rewrite the old, etc. Homoiconicity, that is, the 
technique of 
&lt;em&gt;choosing a uniform representation for objects across otherwise distinct contexts&lt;/em&gt;, 
can then be considered, among other techniques, as a means of 
realizing these advantages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;History of the term&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thinking of homoiconicity as a &lt;em&gt;design concept&lt;/em&gt;, rather than as a formal 
property of a language, is at least not without historical basis. Here we see the first 
recorded use of the term in programming, by Moores and L. Peter Deutsch, 
describing their TRAC® language&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; in the 1965 ACM Proceedings: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the main design goals was that the 
input script of TRAC (what is typed in by the 
user) should be identical to the text which guides 
the internal action of the TRAC processor.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because TRAC procedures and text have the same 
representation inside and outside the processor, 
the term &lt;em&gt;homo-iconic&lt;/em&gt; is applicable, from 
&lt;em&gt;homo&lt;/em&gt; meaning the same, and &lt;em&gt;icon&lt;/em&gt; meaning 
representation.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can see first of all that the term is used as a design concept, 
and that they refer primarily to implementation, rather 
than formal properties of the language itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They attribute the terminology to the suggestion of 
Warren S. McCulloch, after C.S. Peirce, and cite LISP
as an inspiration: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lisp, although elegant in concept, becomes inelegant in practice. 
It even "cheats" in the frequent use of machine-language procedures. 
... Were the S-language the only LISP language, LISP would be close 
to being homo-iconic (excluding the machine-language functions).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Incidentally, TRAC® language (with the registered trademark symbol) 
is one of the three beginner languages recommended by Ted Nelson 
in &lt;em&gt;Computer Lib&lt;/em&gt;, after BASIC and before APL.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has been my experience that a great deal of baggage is frequently

&lt;p&gt;It has been my experience that a great deal of baggage is frequently 
brought into discussions of automated testing: impressions and prejudices 
about what automated testing is, how it should be done, and often an 
impression of what it is for or where it is applicable (and often, it is 
claimed within the web development industry, not applicable).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To cut through this, it helps to get back to basics. There are two obvious
parts to automated testing: the automation, and the testing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Testing&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is simply running your code to see if it does what you expected. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;automate&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; this process means that you &lt;em&gt;write code to help you&lt;/em&gt; run your code, 
&lt;em&gt;and to help you&lt;/em&gt; check if it does what you expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It becomes very clear now that the &lt;strong&gt;testing&lt;/strong&gt; portion here is not just 
a &lt;em&gt;best practice&lt;/em&gt;, it's an inevitable part of software development. 
Whether you are intentional about it or not, spinning up your web server, 
hacking on some code and then reloading to see your changes, is a testing activity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can say more: testing is, with little question, what every developer spends 
the majority of their dev time doing, regardless of whether or not they write 
any automated tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I worked developing web applications in Python, the testing I saw most 
frequently involved running a development server with hot reload:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;flask&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;--app&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;myapp&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;--debug&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;run
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;gunicorn&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;--reload&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;myapp:factory
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The developer then clicks on things to see if their code does what they wanted. 
This process is great, as you get a &lt;strong&gt;fast feedback cycle&lt;/strong&gt; between:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Making changes &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Seeing the results&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is frequently referred to as the &lt;strong&gt;inner programming loop&lt;/strong&gt;, to draw 
attention to its position as a performance bottleneck for programmer productivity. 
If we can speed up this tight inner loop, so the story goes, we can speed up our 
delivery of software. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is: while there is no doubt that you &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; devote a lot of time to writing tests in order to 
obtain other goals, such as more safety or better reliability; even if 
your only priority is speed of development, the logic is clear:
* The faster you can test, the faster you can develop features. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in my experience, automation of testing tasks is one of the easiest and most lucrative 
places to win back development time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Arange, Act, Assert&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Software testing of all kinds (&lt;em&gt;included manual testing&lt;/em&gt;) is most commonly broken down 
into three steps&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Arrange&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: setting up the entities that will be subject to test&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Act&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: Carry out the behavior you want to test &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Assert&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: Check to see if everything did what you wanted it to do&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This falls nicely into a &lt;em&gt;given, when, then&lt;/em&gt; format. An example of a test written 
in this style:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Given&lt;/em&gt; an agency in the database with id = &lt;code&gt;:id&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;When&lt;/em&gt; I hit the &lt;code&gt;delete/:id&lt;/code&gt; endpoint&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Then&lt;/em&gt; the agency with id = &lt;code&gt;:id&lt;/code&gt; should no longer be in the database&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Arrange 🏗&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arranging is the first step, and it's one of the hardest steps of the whole process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I often hear stories like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The bug only happens with specific orders that have this 
combination of three obscure properties"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The difficulty is essential, and still persists with automated testing. 
Indeed, a big part of automated testing frameworks are utilities to help 
you package up precious canned entities so that they can be reused in tests. 
These are called &lt;em&gt;test fixtures&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Automated testing provides a win here because by writing text fixtures as code, 
you can easily reproduce them for many testing scenarios, saving you the time of 
painstakingly reconstructing them by hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Act 🎬&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The acting portion of testing usually isn't as hard to automate:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You probably know what method you wrote to facilitate 
the action you want to test&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You named it with a descriptive name that says what it does (right?), 
and that's what you're testing now!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When testing manually, non-reversible actions can make life hard:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I found a few orders that I can use for testing this, but now that
    I've deleted them I have none left to test with"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Test as small as possible: start by testing the functions 
you are calling from that endpoint, rather than with the 
endpoint itself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing for automated tests can help you to write simpler, better designed 
functions, by focusing on testing one thing at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Assert 🔬&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For asserting, the first piece of advice I would suggest for web development, 
is to move the act of observation back from the frontend as much as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, take care not to assert too much: you are writing a test for one thing, 
so don't assert everything you know about the entity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;CAUTION&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: don't run your function, copy the output, and then paste 
it as the expected result of an assert. ✂️&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You will assert too much, leading to fragile tests 
that break when they don't need to.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are full featured programs for capturing the exact behavior of an 
old version of a program and alerting you to every observable change in 
behavior in a new version, don't try to replicate this facility in your 
    handwritten tests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Automation isn't all-or-nothing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main point I'd like to get across here is that you, as a developer
are empowered to use the tools of automation to make your own development
easier. You can start writing code to help you test, even in a codebase
without a test suite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While a &lt;em&gt;fully-automated&lt;/em&gt; test will do all the arranging, acting, and 
checking of the results, you can start automating parts of the process today:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;function_you_want_to_test&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;order_id&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;None&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# your business logic functions up here&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="vm"&gt;__name__&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;__main__&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;my_app.config&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;config&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;config&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;load&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="n"&gt;order_id&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;27&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# order_id you found in mysql workbench&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;expected&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;function_you_want_to_test&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;order_id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;expected&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nb"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;Everything passed!&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;To run a file, just press the ▶️ button in your code editor or IDE,
everything in the &lt;code&gt;__name__ == '__main__'&lt;/code&gt; block will be executed&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compare this one click to the manual process: &lt;em&gt;starting your server, 
opening up Google Chrome, logging in, navigating to orders, finding 
the right order, selecting the option you want to test from a 
dropdown ...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;General advice&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Test code as you write it&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The earlier a problem is found, the better. If you think systematically about what you are writing as you write it, you can verify simple properties of the program as it is being constructed, with the result that your code will have gone through one round of testing before it is even compiled." -- &lt;em&gt;Practice of Programming&lt;/em&gt;, P&amp;amp;K&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Start with boundary conditions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What should happen in the boundary cases? null case, blank input, negative case etc. 
Cover these first. They are usually the easiest tests to write and easiest cases 
to handle if you do them first, but can get hairy to shoehorn in if you leave 
them to the end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Test to ease refactoring&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adding tests gives you freedom to refactor boldly and with abandon. The smoothest and fastest path to developing a new feature is a scaffolding process:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write tests to make refactoring easy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Refactor to make adding the feature easy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write simple tests for your feature&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get your tests to pass as easily as you like&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Refactor boldly until satisfied&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the &lt;em&gt;architecture&lt;/em&gt; of a system, I mean the complete and detailed specification of the user interface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These days, user interfaces are collections of dropdowns, buttons, form fields, and styling choices. We'd hardly think of them as architectural. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Brooks goes on to explains what he means by user interfaces, and by a detailed specification of it: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a computer this is the programming manual. For a compiler it is the language manual. For a control program it is the manuals for the language or languages used to invoke its functions. For the entire system it is the union of the manuals the user must consult to do his entire job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've given up on writing user manuals for software interfaces. User interfaces are supposed to be "intuitive" and "self-explanatory", using techniques like "progressive disclosure". User interfaces don't come with documents. The modern equivalent of what Brooks is refering to is API documentation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the modern interpretation of Brooks' definition of &lt;em&gt;architecture&lt;/em&gt; is something along the lines of the collection of interfacts to the high-level application modules: the public APIs, object and methods that different parts of the system will consume to carry out tasks for the user.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="programming"></category><category term="design"></category><category term="software"></category></entry><entry><title>Python and JavaScript performance</title><link href="https://ethmcc.github.io/python-js-tracing-jit" rel="alternate"></link><published>2021-12-15T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2021-12-15T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Ethan McCarthy</name></author><id>tag:ethmcc.github.io,2021-12-15:/python-js-tracing-jit</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I came across &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/3PcIJKd1PKU"&gt;a cheeky little demonstration&lt;/a&gt; on YouTube comparing the same algorithm written in Python, C, and x86 assembly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;... with the naive equivalent in Python:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;isPrime&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;numPrimes&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;range&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;250001&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;numPrimes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;+=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;isPrime&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nb"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;str&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;numPrimes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Here are my own quick-and-dirty performance results:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;%&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;gcc&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;-o&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;primes&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;primes.c

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wow! 83 times slower. Nothing too suprising, though: just the difference between an interpreted language like Python, and a compiled language like C. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But wait, I do use another scripting language regularly: JavaScript. Let's see how JavaScript fares.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;isPrime&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;Math&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;floor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;++&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;numPrimes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;250001&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;++&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;numPrimes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;+=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;isPrime&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;numPrimes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Since JavaScript is another interpreted language, we'd expect its performance to be closer to Python than to compiled C, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;%&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;time&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;node&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;primes.js
&lt;span class="m"&gt;22044&lt;/span&gt;
node&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;primes.js&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;.49s&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;user&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;.04s&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;system&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;96&lt;/span&gt;%&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;cpu&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;.574&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;total
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;What?! 87 percent faster than the compiled C program? Is JavaScript really faster than C?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, not quite, we forgot to turn optimization on when we compiled our C code: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;%&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;gcc&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;-O&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;-o&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;primes&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;primes.c

&lt;span class="m"&gt;22044&lt;/span&gt;
./primes&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;.87s&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;user&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;.01s&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;system&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;84&lt;/span&gt;%&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;cpu&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;.032&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;total
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;We can let out a sigh of relief, C with basic optimizations is still 71% faster than our JavaScript code.&lt;sup id="fnref:footnote"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why is JavaScript so fast? Well, node uses V8, which utilizes a tracing JIT compiler. While code is running, it looks for segments of "hot" code to optimize into machine code. Since our program is two big hot loops, they get optimized and JavaScript runs this simple algorithm on the order of as fast as C.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But wait, Python also has an implementation with a tracing JIT compiler, called pypy. So can Python achieve the same performance?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;%&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;time&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;pypy&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;primes.py
&lt;span class="m"&gt;22044&lt;/span&gt;
pypy&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;test.py&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;102&lt;/span&gt;.81s&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;user&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;.39s&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;system&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;99&lt;/span&gt;%&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;cpu&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;:43.39&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;total
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Over twice as fast as the CPython running time, but still orders of magnitude slower than JavaScript. What's going on? If both pypy and the V8 engine use the same basic techniques, shouldn't the performance be similar?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's look at the code: they all have pretty much the same structure. What stands out in the Python version and not in the C and JavaScript versions is the use of Python's &lt;code&gt;range&lt;/code&gt; iterator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Python doesn't have C-style loops, but we can emulate it with a while loop and post-increment:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;isPrime&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;while&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;//&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ow"&gt;not&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)):&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;numPrimes&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;while&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;250001&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;numPrimes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;+=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;isPrime&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nb"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;str&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;numPrimes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;And now let's try pypy again:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;%&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;time&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;pypy&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;primes2.py
&lt;span class="m"&gt;22044&lt;/span&gt;
pypy&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;primes2.py&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;.18s&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;user&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;.07s&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;system&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;97&lt;/span&gt;%&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;cpu&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;.364&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;total
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Wow! Of course, this is still 2.8 times slower than our node result, but at least we seem to be in the same ballpark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, before you run off to your Python code bases to remove idiomatic loops and iterators, and replace them with &lt;code&gt;while&lt;/code&gt; loops and imperative looping variables, keep in mind: when running with CPython, there is no such win to be had. A CPython implementation will be just as slow either way. Stick with the nice, readable iterator loops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lesson here is that pypy and tracing JIT is no silver bullet to Python performance. V8-like results on idomatic Python are not here yet, and a Python for loop is still not a place you want to be if you're running a &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\Theta(n^2)\)&lt;/span&gt; algorithm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:footnote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Higher optimization levels don't help (in fact, they actually hurt a bit &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-TLSBdHe1A"&gt;(a not uncommon state of affairs)&lt;/a&gt;).&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Pomodoro time-management technique uses sets of four &amp;quot;Pomodoro&amp;quot; work intervals, so-named after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer used by its inventor, Francesco Cirillo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each Pomodoro interval is a 25-minute period of uninterrupted work, between which a short break is taken (3-5 minutes). After completing four consecutive Pomodoros, a longer break is taken (15-30 minutes).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This Pomoduino Clock keeps track of your completed Pomodoros on the liquid-crystal display with a cute, custom tomato glyph. After each work period, you'll be notified to take a break with a short chime. After you complete four Pomodoros, you'll be notified to take a longer break with a longer chime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting in the practice of writing a bit daily can be a helpful grounding exercise. Weather Journal is a native Android application, written in Java, with the simple premise of being a place to go each day to maintain a bit of writing ritual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It interfaces with Android location services for GPS location, and interfaces with a third-party web API to fetch your local weather report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Journal entries are stored in a local SQLite database, and can be edited or deleted from the app. The app also interfaces with the file system to export journal notes to text files, wherever you may want to archive them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Either way, although this quine is brilliantly short, it's actually fairly easily parseable at sight. The only genuine bit of obfuscation is that &lt;code&gt;$&lt;/code&gt; is being used as a variable name. You might reasonably assume this is a trick to get the variable name to match up with the template literal string (the sort of thing that does actually happen frequently with quines), but here it doesn't actually serve any purpose apart from obfuscation. We could use another variable name and we'd still have a quine just the same:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;func&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sb"&gt;`(func=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;func&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sb"&gt;)()`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Pop open a console in your web browser and try it out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can parse it by hand a bit more clearly if we look first at this bit of code:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;func&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;_&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sb"&gt;`func=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;X&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sb"&gt;;func();`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;func&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;If &lt;code&gt;X&lt;/code&gt; were a defined expression in our source code, this would be valid JavaScript code. The first statement (terminated by the semi-colon) assigns an arrow function to the variable name &lt;code&gt;func&lt;/code&gt;. The second statement executes the function we just stored in &lt;code&gt;func&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The arrow function itself ignores its input and just returns what looks like a JavaScript assignment from a template placeholder to the variable named &lt;code&gt;func&lt;/code&gt;, followed by an execution statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plugging in &lt;code&gt;func&lt;/code&gt; itself: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;func&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;_&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sb"&gt;`func=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;func&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sb"&gt;;func();`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;func&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Now we have a fully valid piece of JavaScript code. The thing that makes this quine actually work, and makes the JavaScript language almost a cheating language for writing quines in, is JavaScript's &lt;code&gt;Function.prototype.toString()&lt;/code&gt; method, described &lt;a href="https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-function.prototype.tostring"&gt;here in the ECMAScript 262 specification&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If &lt;code&gt;Type(func)&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;Object&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;func&lt;/code&gt; has a &lt;code&gt;SourceText&lt;/code&gt; internal slot and &lt;code&gt;func&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;SourceText&lt;/code&gt; is a sequence of Unicode code points and &lt;code&gt;! HostHasSourceTextAvailable(func)&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt;, then
Return &lt;code&gt;! UTF16Encode(func.[[SourceText]])&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, when we load our arrow expression into the variable &lt;code&gt;func&lt;/code&gt;, the &lt;code&gt;Function&lt;/code&gt; constructor gets called and remembers the source-code within the &lt;code&gt;SourceText&lt;/code&gt; internal slot of the &lt;code&gt;new&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;Function&lt;/code&gt; object constructed. Then that source code just gets printed out when we call the &lt;code&gt;toString&lt;/code&gt; method on the function or, in this case, when the template literal's placeholder calls the &lt;code&gt;toString()&lt;/code&gt; method implicitly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, this "cheating" makes JavaScript a perfect example language for proving Kleene's Recursion Theorem. Let's first look at the formal statement of the recursion theorem:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(f:\omega\rightarrow\omega\)&lt;/span&gt; be computable. There is an index &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(e\in\omega\)&lt;/span&gt; such that &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\varphi_e=\varphi_{f(e)}\)&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now let's suppose we take JavaScript functions as our model of computation (which assumes we've looked after some pesky details, like that we've implemented some suitable class to handle arbitrarily large integer inputs, JavaScript's memory bound of &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(2^{32}\)&lt;/span&gt; notwithstanding our imagination). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How is our indexing of partial-computable functions defined? To obtain the &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(e'th\)&lt;/span&gt; partial-computable function &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\varphi_e\)&lt;/span&gt;, render &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(e\)&lt;/span&gt; in base &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(1,112,064\)&lt;/span&gt;, interpret it as a UTF-16 string, and run it as JavaScript source through a JavaScript interpreter. (There are a number of reasonable ways to define input and output here, or for a cleaner take, we could abstract away input-ouput and view the &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(e'th\)&lt;/span&gt; program as representing the &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(e'th\)&lt;/span&gt; computably-enumerable set.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since JavaScript has a &lt;code&gt;.toString()&lt;/code&gt; method built into its functions, finding fixed points is easy: given a total computable function &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(f\)&lt;/span&gt;, let &lt;code&gt;source&lt;/code&gt; be some source code fed into our algorithm (however we've decided to handle input), compute &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(f(f.toString())\)&lt;/span&gt; and execute it like so: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;source&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;source&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;eval&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;source&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;toString&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;())();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Interpret this source code as the UTF-16 string &lt;code&gt;f=${_e}$;\n f(f.toString())();&lt;/code&gt; representing a number &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(e\)&lt;/span&gt; in base &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(1,112,064\)&lt;/span&gt;. Then by definition &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\varphi_e=\varphi_{f(e)}\)&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, if you don't want to ordain JavaScript as our distinguished model of computation, you might complain about this proof: JavaScript after all is just cheating by storing the source code of our functions. But in fact, if we can prove Kleene's recursion theorem for JavaScript, then any othe language or computation model will follow by a simple lifting argument, assuming either model can simulate computations in the other. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The essence of this argument is a pattern of mind-bending reasoning that comes up frequently in computability theory: because the recursion theorem &lt;em&gt;might as well hold&lt;/em&gt;, it in fact &lt;em&gt;must hold&lt;/em&gt;. But those details are for another post. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A crime has taken place and the detective needs your help. The detective gave you the crime scene report, but you somehow lost it. You vaguely remember that the crime was a ​murder​ that occurred sometime on ​Jan.15, 2018​ and that it took place in ​SQL City​. Start by retrieving the corresponding crime scene report from the police department’s database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can check it out for yourself here: &lt;a href="http://mystery.knightlab.com/"&gt;SQL Murder Mystery&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spoiler alert, here's how my experience went below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alright, I know I want to look at the &lt;code&gt;crime_scene_reports&lt;/code&gt;, but looking at the scheme table doesn't tell me what the &lt;code&gt;date&lt;/code&gt; format is so I'll check first:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;select&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;crime_scene_report&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;limit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;date&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;description&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;                                         &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;city&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="mi"&gt;20180115&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;robbery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Man&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Dressed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Spider&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Man&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Is&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;on&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Robbery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Spree&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;NYC&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Alright, looks like yyymmdd, so let's grab our crime scene report:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;select&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;description&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;crime_scene_report&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;where&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;murder&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;and&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;city&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;SQL City&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;and&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;date&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;20180115&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;description
Security footage shows that there were 2 witnesses. The first witness lives at
the last house on &amp;quot;Northwestern Dr&amp;quot;. The second witness, named Annabel, lives
somewhere on &amp;quot;Franklin Ave&amp;quot;.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;select&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;person&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;where&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;like&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;Annabel%&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;and&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;address_street_name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;like&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;Franklin%&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;           &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;license_id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;address_number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;address_street_name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;ssn&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="mi"&gt;16371&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Annabel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Miller&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;490173&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;     &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;103&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;            &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Franklin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Ave&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;318771143&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;If it were real life, I'd probably try both &lt;code&gt;asc&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;desc&lt;/code&gt; for the "last house."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;select&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;person&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;where&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;address_street_name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;Northwestern Dr&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;order&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;by&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;address_number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;desc&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;limit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;           &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;license_id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;address_number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;address_street_name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;ssn&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="mi"&gt;14887&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Morty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Schapiro&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;118009&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;     &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;4919&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;           &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Northwestern&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Dr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;     &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;111564949&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried Morty's interview first and never actually went back to Annabel's (turns out she didn't have one).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;select&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;transcript&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;interview&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;where&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;person_id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;14887&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;transcript&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;I&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;heard&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;gunshot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;and&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;saw&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;man&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;run&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;out&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;He&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;had&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nv"&gt;started&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;with&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;48Z&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;Only&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;gold&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;members&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;have&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;those&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;bags&lt;/span&gt;.
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;The&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;man&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;got&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;into&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;car&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;with&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;plate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;that&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;included&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;H42W&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Alright, another basic command here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;select&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;get_fit_now_member&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;where&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;like&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;48Z%&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;and&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;membership_status&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;gold&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well now, not narrowed down yet. Finally we get to use some &lt;code&gt;join&lt;/code&gt;s!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;select&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;get_fit_now_member&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;get_fit_now_member&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;join&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;person&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;on&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;get_fit_now_member&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;person_id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;person&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;join&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;drivers_license&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;on&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;person&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;license_id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;drivers_license&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;where&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;get_fit_now_member&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;like&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;48Z%&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;and&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;get_fit_now_member&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;membership_status&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;gold&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;name
Jeremy Bowers
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;There's our perp!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exercise goes on and asks you to find out the mastermind behind it, let's look to see if our perp had an interview:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;select&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;transcript&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;interview&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;where&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;person_id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;67318&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;transcript
I was hired by a woman with a lot of money. I don&amp;#39;t know her
name but I know she&amp;#39;s around 5&amp;#39;5&amp;quot; (65&amp;quot;) or 5&amp;#39;7&amp;quot; (67&amp;quot;). She
has red hair and she drives a Tesla Model S. I know that she
attended the SQL Symphony Concert 3 times in December 2017.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Alright now, challenge! Let's try to do this in a single shot. We're going to have to &lt;code&gt;join&lt;/code&gt; our &lt;code&gt;person&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;drivers_license&lt;/code&gt; tables with the &lt;code&gt;facebook_event_checkin&lt;/code&gt; table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;select&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;facebook_event_checkin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;event_name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;facebook_event_checkin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;date&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;person&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;join&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;drivers_license&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;on&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;person&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;license_id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;drivers_license&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;join&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;facebook_event_checkin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;on&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;facebook_event_checkin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;person_id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;person&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;

It lends itself to a very natural solution with Monads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn't see any other submission that took a monadic approach to this problem at all, so I thought I'd share. Here's the problem:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Write a function which takes a string as input, e.g. "hello, this is a sentence", and then outputs another string where each word (space delimited) longer than 5 characters is reversed. So for our example input, the output should be: ",olleh this is a ecnetnes".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a procedural language, especially ones with excellent support for string manipulation like Python or Javascript, the most obvious approach is to split up the input string into words by splitting along &lt;code&gt;" "&lt;/code&gt;, then walk through that list of words with a loop, with an if-block checking if the length of the word is long enough and then reversing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, Haskell has enough syntactic sugar to do a list comprehension, or we could &lt;code&gt;words&lt;/code&gt; our string and then walk through it with a &lt;code&gt;foldl&lt;/code&gt; (or for perfomance's sake probably a &lt;code&gt;foldr&lt;/code&gt; would be superior), concatenating at each step of the fold with either the next string or the reverse of the next string depending on your Boolean value. In the end, this solution would look a lot like a solution written in Python or Javascript, and it's the approach I saw taken in every other submission on the kata.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the best code in Haskell, in my opinion, doesn't just devolve back into simulating for loops and if blocks. Haskell reads cleanest when it starts with very simple functions, and then combines those functions in standard ways to build up bigger functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The thing about this style of programming is that the minute you start doing it, you immediately run into Monads.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alright, let's get started. I'll be working in the interactive environment:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;$&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;ghci
GHCi,&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;version&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;.8.4:&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;https://www.haskell.org/ghc/&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;:?&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;help&lt;/span&gt;
Loaded&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;package&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;environment&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;from&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;~/.ghc/x86_64-darwin-8.8.4/environments/default
Prelude&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The whole time, I'll be using ghci to check type annotations of expressions we write, using the &lt;code&gt;:type&lt;/code&gt; command. Looking at how GHC interprets our type annotations will actually drive a lot of our coding: we're practicing &lt;em&gt;type driven development&lt;/em&gt;, perhaps? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We only really need two basic functions here. We could probably do with less, but to keep it super clear, let's write two: &lt;code&gt;condRev&lt;/code&gt;, which either reverses or doesn't reverse a string, depending on a Boolean parameter, and &lt;code&gt;isLong&lt;/code&gt;, which takes an &lt;code&gt;Int&lt;/code&gt; and a &lt;code&gt;String&lt;/code&gt; and let's us know whether the string is longer than the int.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;Prelude&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;condRev&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ow"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ow"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kr"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kr"&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;reverse&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kr"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;s&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kt"&gt;Prelude&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;condRev&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nf"&gt;condRev&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ow"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;Bool&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ow"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ow"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kt"&gt;Prelude&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;isLong&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ow"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;flip&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;length&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kt"&gt;Prelude&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;isLong&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nf"&gt;isLong&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ow"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;Foldable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ow"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;Int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ow"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ow"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;Bool&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Now you might not notice it, but we're working already in a Monad! Specifically, we're in the &lt;code&gt;(-&amp;gt;) r&lt;/code&gt; monad. We'll need &lt;code&gt;Control.Monad&lt;/code&gt;, so let's import it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;Prelude&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kr"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nn"&gt;Control.Monad&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kt"&gt;Prelude&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;Control&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;Monad&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;(-&amp;gt;) r&lt;/code&gt; Monad is a context for computation where all the monadic objects are functions with an &lt;code&gt;r&lt;/code&gt; input. For us, by the way, &lt;code&gt;r&lt;/code&gt; is the parameterized type &lt;code&gt;[a]&lt;/code&gt; in GHCi's type annotations above. Actually, for our problem we're specifically interested in &lt;code&gt;[Char]&lt;/code&gt;, or more readably, &lt;code&gt;String&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How do we know we want to be in the &lt;code&gt;(-&amp;gt;) String&lt;/code&gt; Monad?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, &lt;code&gt;isLong&lt;/code&gt; is a function taking an &lt;code&gt;Int&lt;/code&gt; and a &lt;code&gt;String&lt;/code&gt; and outputting a &lt;code&gt;Bool&lt;/code&gt;, but we don't want to think about it that way: we'd rather think of it as a function taking an &lt;code&gt;Int&lt;/code&gt; as a parameter, and then returning a function &lt;code&gt;:: String -&amp;gt; Bool&lt;/code&gt;, i.e. a &lt;code&gt;(-&amp;gt;) String Bool&lt;/code&gt;. If we write &lt;code&gt;m&lt;/code&gt; for our &lt;code&gt;(-&amp;gt;) String&lt;/code&gt; Monad, then we can write this as &lt;code&gt;m Bool&lt;/code&gt;. It's a &lt;em&gt;monadic Boolean&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Same thing for &lt;code&gt;condRev&lt;/code&gt;. It's certainly a function that takes a &lt;code&gt;Bool&lt;/code&gt; and a &lt;code&gt;String&lt;/code&gt; and outputs a &lt;code&gt;String&lt;/code&gt;, but we'd rather think of it as a function that takes a &lt;code&gt;Bool&lt;/code&gt; and then outputs a function &lt;code&gt;:: String -&amp;gt; String&lt;/code&gt;, i.e. a monadic string.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;In short: the data we're really interested in manipulating is all parameterized by strings, so it makes sense to be in the &lt;code&gt;(-&amp;gt;) String&lt;/code&gt; Monad.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From our perspective inside the &lt;code&gt;(-&amp;gt;) String&lt;/code&gt; Monad, we think of &lt;code&gt;isLong&lt;/code&gt; as a monadic function of type &lt;code&gt;:: Int -&amp;gt; m Bool&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;condRev&lt;/code&gt; as a monadic function of type &lt;code&gt;:: Bool -&amp;gt; m String&lt;/code&gt;. We want to compose these two monadic functions and get a monadic function of type &lt;code&gt;:: Int -&amp;gt; m String&lt;/code&gt;, so we use the Kleisli arrow:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;Prelude&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;Control&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;Monad&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ow"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;Monad&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ow"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ow"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ow"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ow"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;c&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ow"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ow"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;c&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Exactly what we want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;Prelude&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;Control&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;Monad&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;condFlipWord&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ow"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;isLong&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;condRev&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kt"&gt;Prelude&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;Control&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;Monad&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;condFlipWord&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nf"&gt;condFlipWord&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ow"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;Int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ow"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ow"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;What does &lt;code&gt;condFlipWord&lt;/code&gt; do? Well, it takes an &lt;code&gt;Int&lt;/code&gt; and outputs a monadic &lt;code&gt;String&lt;/code&gt;, or rather, a function from &lt;code&gt;String&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;String&lt;/code&gt;. Looking at the logic of &lt;code&gt;isLong&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;condRev&lt;/code&gt; it's easy to see what their Kleisli composition does:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;Prelude&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;Control&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;Monad&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;condFlipWord&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;jumping&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;gnipmuj&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kt"&gt;Prelude&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;Control&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;Monad&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;condFlipWord&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;jumping&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;jumping&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Of course, we're not quite done. We wanted a function that didn't flip a whole string depending on the string's length, but rather operated on each individual word in the string.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will be helpful to use the library function &lt;code&gt;words&lt;/code&gt;. Let's check its type and play around with it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;Prelude&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;Control&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;Monad&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;words&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nf"&gt;words&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ow"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ow"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kt"&gt;Prelude&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;Control&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;Monad&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;words&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;this is a sentence&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;this&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;is&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;a&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;sentence&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;Now we're already running into another Monad, albeit likely a more familiar one.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yep, it's &lt;code&gt;[]&lt;/code&gt;, the List monad. Of course, the functor for mapping functions into a List datatype is &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt;. But we don't want to &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt; our whole &lt;code&gt;condFlipWords&lt;/code&gt; function there:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;Prelude&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;Control&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;Monad&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;condFlipWord&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nf"&gt;map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;condFlipWord&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ow"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;Int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ow"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ow"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Instead we just want to pass the &lt;code&gt;String -&amp;gt; String&lt;/code&gt; &lt;em&gt;output&lt;/em&gt; of our &lt;code&gt;condFlipWord&lt;/code&gt; function, i.e. we just want to &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt; the &lt;em&gt;output&lt;/em&gt; of our function. In other words, we want to &lt;em&gt;compose&lt;/em&gt; the output of &lt;code&gt;condFlipWord&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;Prelude&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;Control&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;Monad&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;condFlipWords&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ow"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;condFlipWord&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kt"&gt;Prelude&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;Control&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;Monad&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;condFlipWords&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nf"&gt;condFlipWords&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ow"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;Int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ow"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ow"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kt"&gt;Prelude&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;Control&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;Monad&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;condFlipWords&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;words&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;this is a sentence&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;this&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;is&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;a&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;ecnetnes&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Of course, we also want to pre-compose our function with &lt;code&gt;words&lt;/code&gt; so it will start with a string input, and post-compose with &lt;code&gt;unwords&lt;/code&gt; so it returns the flattened string as output.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;We just have to be careful about the position of arguments and where we apply the compositions:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;Prelude&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;Control&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;Monad&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;condFlipWords&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;words&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;interactive&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;17&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ne"&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;•&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;Couldn&amp;#39;t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;match&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kr"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;‘&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;’&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;with&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;‘&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;Int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;’&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kt"&gt;Prelude&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;Control&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;Monad&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;flip&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;condFlipWords&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;words&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nf"&gt;flip&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;condFlipWords&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;words&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ow"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ow"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;Int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ow"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;Char&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Great! We also need to &lt;code&gt;unwords&lt;/code&gt; it to get back from &lt;code&gt;[[Char]]&lt;/code&gt; (i.e. &lt;code&gt;[String]&lt;/code&gt;) to &lt;code&gt;String&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;Prelude&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;Control&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;Monad&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;unwords&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;flip&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;condFlipWords&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;words&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;interactive&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;12&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ne"&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;•&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;Couldn&amp;#39;t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;match&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kr"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;‘&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;Int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ow"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;Char&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;’&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;with&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;‘&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;’&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Oops! Our final curried output of &lt;code&gt;flip condFlipWords . words&lt;/code&gt; is of type &lt;code&gt;:: [String]&lt;/code&gt;, but the uncurried output is of type &lt;code&gt;:: Int -&amp;gt; [String]&lt;/code&gt;, which we can't plug into &lt;code&gt;unwords&lt;/code&gt;. We &lt;em&gt;only want to unwords the output&lt;/em&gt;. Again, that means a composition: in this case using &lt;code&gt;(unwords .)&lt;/code&gt;. Let's check its type first to make sure this operator makes sense to use:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;Prelude&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;Control&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;Monad&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;unwords&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;unwords&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ow"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ow"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ow"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ow"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Yep! Exactly what we need. Let's verify we get the type we wanted when we compose:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;Prelude&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;Control&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;Monad&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;unwords&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;flip&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;condFlipWords&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;words&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;unwords&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;flip&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;condFlipWords&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;words&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ow"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ow"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;Int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ow"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Perfect! Or almost: we'd rather flip the parameters back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;Prelude&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;Control&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;Monad&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;condFlipSentence&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ow"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;flip&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;unwords&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;flip&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;condFlipWords&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;words&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Our particular problem statement considered words of length 5 or longer to be long, so with a bit of partial application:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;Prelude&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;Control&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;Monad&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;flipWords&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ow"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;condFlipSentence&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Here's the final behavior of our function:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;Prelude&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;Control&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;Monad&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;flipWords&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;this is a sentence&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;this is a ecnetnes&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Here's the whole code:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kr"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nn"&gt;Control.Monad&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'll eschew pointing to any particular examples, as they can get pretty heated. 
It all revolves around the terms "lambda expression" (or "lambda", for short), a 
term which originated in the mathematical side of computer science, and "anonymous 
function", which is a programming term. So what's going on here?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Functions in JavaScript are values that can be passed around like any other values, 
e.g. string values, number values, or other object values. This is sometimes expressed 
in the phrase “functions as first class citizens”. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's best to think of these values like actual values: a function value is just 
some object living in memory. Let me be clear: when I say &lt;em&gt;function value&lt;/em&gt; here, 
I don't mean the value taken by a function on some input, I mean the function object 
itself: &lt;em&gt;the value in memory that the function&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;is&lt;/strong&gt;, itself, per se, intrinsically 
(mind blown).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is worth here keeping a distinction in mind between &lt;em&gt;reference types&lt;/em&gt; and 
&lt;em&gt;value types&lt;/em&gt;. Functions are a &lt;em&gt;reference type&lt;/em&gt;, whereas types like strings or numbers 
are &lt;em&gt;value types&lt;/em&gt;. For value types, we get the following behavior as one might expect: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;===&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;===&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;four&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;===&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;four&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;f&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;our&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;===&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;four&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;But for functions, we create separate objects each time we evaluate a function literal: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;===&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Arrays work similarly:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;===&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;If you come from a C background, you can think of what JavaScript is doing when 
it evaluates the array literal &lt;code&gt;[1,2,3]&lt;/code&gt; as creating a new array in memory, dumping 
the contents &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;2&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;3&lt;/code&gt; into consecutive addresses in memory, and returning a pointer 
to the first address (the one storing the &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In JavaScript, a function is defined either within a &lt;em&gt;function declaration&lt;/em&gt;, or 
a &lt;em&gt;function expression&lt;/em&gt;. A function declaration announces to the JavaScript engine 
that it should note information about the existence of a function, and attaches 
it to an identifier within the enclosing environment. A declared function is “named” 
within its enclosing environment, so it can be called later. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How is this done? Pretty much how you might expect: when an environment is created
, a map of key-value pairs is created which translates identifiers into the objects 
in scope. Whenever we have a call to some name in that environment (or, with lower 
priority, in a child environment), we can look at the identifier table to find out 
what object the name refers to. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The very basic but very important thing to realize here is this: to tell whether 
a function is “anonymous” or “named” &lt;em&gt;depends on which environment we're talking about&lt;/em&gt;. 
The name of a function is a property of the environment, &lt;em&gt;not of the function&lt;/em&gt;. 
Within a given environment, the named functions are those functions with names in 
the key-value store of identifiers, the anonymous functions are all the other functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, JavaScript makes it more confusing than that: in JavaScript, the 
function object itself may have a property field, called &lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt;. You can understand 
why such a property would be useful: recursion and debugging logs come to mind. 
However some sort of “name”-ish thing, which is a property of a function rather 
than a property of an enclosing environment, is very much a different concept from 
an identifier as we talk about them in general programming. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, let's use a JavaScript &lt;em&gt;function expression&lt;/em&gt; to define a function with 
a &lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt; property of &lt;code&gt;foo&lt;/code&gt;, and then try to call it as if that name were a valid 
identifier:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;fooVar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;foo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kc"&gt;undefined&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;fooVar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;foo&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;foo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Uncaught&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ne"&gt;ReferenceError&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;foo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;not&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;defined&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;We can see that in fact, whatever the “name” field of this function which holds 
&lt;code&gt;foo&lt;/code&gt; is, it certainly doesn't provide an identifier within the enclosing environment. 
It's a &lt;em&gt;named anonymous function&lt;/em&gt;? Oh sure it has a name, but it keeps that name 
anonymous to everyone else. If you prefer to sweep the unpleasant contradiction 
under the rug, Mozilla calls this a &lt;em&gt;named function expression&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, the name field does serve as an identifier, but not in the environment 
the function is being used in: 
&lt;em&gt;it serves as an identifier within the function's own function environment&lt;/em&gt;. 
Again, the essential point: whether a function is anonymous or not is a property 
of the environment, not the function: foo above is anonymous in the outside environment, 
but named in its own environment. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;foo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;foo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;foo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)}(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="mf"&gt;21&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Of course, in our &lt;code&gt;fooVar&lt;/code&gt; example we &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; provide, in a roundabout way, an identifier 
for this function in the variable named &lt;code&gt;fooVar&lt;/code&gt;. In fact, if we don't provide an 
explicit name for the name field, ECMAScript's spec requires that an assignment 
of a variable identifier to also set the internal name field of the function object 
constructed, even works for arrow functions: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;foo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kc"&gt;undefined&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;foo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;foo&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;foo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="mf"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;If you don't like the variable assignment example because it still had the identifier 
&lt;code&gt;fooVar&lt;/code&gt;, rest assured we can have genuinely &lt;em&gt;“named anonymous functions”&lt;/em&gt; in JavaScript: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;foo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="mf"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;this function is named &amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;foo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;this function is named foo&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;foo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Uncaught&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ne"&gt;ReferenceError&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;foo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;not&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;defined&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alright, so the term &lt;em&gt;anonymous function&lt;/em&gt; is a bit tricky when applied to JavaScript. 
What about &lt;em&gt;lambda&lt;/em&gt;? Well, the best equivalent (within the JavaScript world) to 
the meaning of the phrase &lt;em&gt;lambda expression&lt;/em&gt; (outside the JavaScript world) is 
&lt;em&gt;function expression&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JavaScript has always had function expressions, even before it introduced the 
&lt;em&gt;arrow function expressions&lt;/em&gt; notation that approximates the syntax of &lt;em&gt;lambda expressions&lt;/em&gt; 
from the lambda calculus and other languages with similar syntax. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nowadays, if someone talks about a &lt;em&gt;lambda&lt;/em&gt; in JavaScript, they're often referring 
to a function expression that uses the &lt;em&gt;arrow function&lt;/em&gt; syntax, or they could simply 
be referring to any function expression. It can be important to distinguish between 
&lt;em&gt;function expressions&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;arrow function expressions&lt;/em&gt;, since they behave a little 
differently with how their &lt;code&gt;this&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;arguments&lt;/code&gt; properties are constructed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what's the lesson to be learned here? Well, it's best to avoid the term 
&lt;em&gt;anonymous function&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;lambda&lt;/em&gt; in JavaScript. JavaScript has &lt;em&gt;function declarations&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;function expressions&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;arrow function expressions&lt;/em&gt;, and those are the best 
terms to use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have to translate general computer science ideas from outside the JavaScript 
world into the JavaScript world: &lt;em&gt;lambda expression&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;anonymous function&lt;/em&gt;, and 
&lt;em&gt;function expression&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;function literal&lt;/em&gt; from the outside world all translate 
to &lt;em&gt;function expression&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;arrow function expression&lt;/em&gt; in the JavaScript world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Function expressions can be &lt;em&gt;named&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;anonymous&lt;/em&gt;, but it's important to understand 
how that distinction has to do with an internal property of functions in JavaScript, 
whereas the general computer-science concept of &lt;em&gt;anonymous function&lt;/em&gt; has to do with 
lexical scoping and bound identifiers within an environment.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="programming"></category><category term="javascript"></category><category term="lambda expressions"></category><category term="anonymous functions"></category></entry><entry><title>Representing Sudoku variants as set multicover problems</title><link href="https://ethmcc.github.io/sudoku-multicover" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-05-23T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2020-05-23T00:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Ethan McCarthy</name></author><id>tag:ethmcc.github.io,2020-05-23:/sudoku-multicover</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;In previous posts, I introduced &lt;a href="../miracle-sudoku"&gt;the Miracle Sudoku&lt;/a&gt; variant and &lt;a href="../sudoku"&gt;my variant sudoku solver package&lt;/a&gt;, which I used for enumerating solutions to that variant.

I also explained &lt;a href="../dancing-links"&gt;the algorithm that package uses&lt;/a&gt; for solving set-multicover problems: Knuth's &lt;em&gt;dancing links&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this post, I'll quickly explain how Sudoku problems can be represented as set multicover problems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recall the definition of an &lt;em&gt;exact cover&lt;/em&gt; problem, and its generalization to &lt;em&gt;set multicover&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;multiset multicover&lt;/em&gt; problems:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A covering problem instance consists of a set of &lt;em&gt;constraints&lt;/em&gt; and a set of &lt;em&gt;choices&lt;/em&gt;. The constraints simply form an abstract set, with each &lt;em&gt;choice&lt;/em&gt; being a subset of the constraints. The intended interpretation is that a given choice &lt;em&gt;satisfies&lt;/em&gt; its &lt;em&gt;constraints&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of an exact cover problem is to pick a minimal set of choices to satisfy every constraint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we have a matrix representation of exact cover problems:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To put things more concretely, we can take the same approach as Knuth and view the covering problem instance as a 2D matrix, where columns correspond to constraints and rows correspond to choices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enumerating the columns &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(c\)&lt;/span&gt; and rows &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(r\)&lt;/span&gt;, we get a matrix representation &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(A\)&lt;/span&gt; of the covering problem by placing a &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(1\)&lt;/span&gt; in &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(A(r, c)\)&lt;/span&gt; if choice &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(r\)&lt;/span&gt; belongs to constraint &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(c\)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For &lt;em&gt;set multicover&lt;/em&gt; problems, the constraints are a &lt;em&gt;multiset&lt;/em&gt;, with the intended interpretation being that a constraint which appears with multiplicity should be satisfied as many times as the multiplicity demands. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another generalization we will require for variant sudoku is to allow for some constraints to be &lt;em&gt;optional&lt;/em&gt;: meaning that they can fail to be satisfied, but must not be satisfied more than the specified limit of times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's easier to start with a simpler combinatorial example: the &lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="math"&gt;\(n\)&lt;/span&gt; queens problem&lt;/em&gt;. For &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(n=8\)&lt;/span&gt;, the problem asks to find a way to place &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(8\)&lt;/span&gt; queens on a standard chessboard so that no queen attacks any other queen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem can be represented as an exact cover problem with some optional constraints. The constraints can be identified with the rows (ranks) and columns (files) of the board, along with optional constraints for each diagonal. Each square on the board is a choice, satisfying the row, column, and two diagonals the square belongs to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our &lt;code&gt;Sudoku.multicover&lt;/code&gt; module, we can represent the &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(8\)&lt;/span&gt;-queens problem as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;sudoku.multicover&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;SetMultiCover&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;SMC&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;n_queens_problem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;constraints&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;queen_on_position&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;j&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;queen_on_rank&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;queen_on_file&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;j&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;queen_on_backward_diag&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;j&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;n&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;queen_on_forward_diag&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;j&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;j&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;j&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;range&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;j&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;range&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)]&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;SMC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;constraints&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;must_satisfy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;r&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;r&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;queen_on_rank&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;queen_on_file&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;range&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)]&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;N&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="sa"&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;----&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Found &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;sum&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;_&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;n_queens_problem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;N&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt; solutions to the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;N&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt; queens problem&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Output ... &lt;/summary&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;----
Found&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;92&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;solutions&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;to&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;the&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;queens&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;problem
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can take the ranks and files as required constraints because a solution to the &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(8\)&lt;/span&gt; queens problem will necessarily satisfy each of those constraints: we have to place &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(8\)&lt;/span&gt; queens on the baord, there are only 8 ranks and 8 files, and no two queens can occupy the same rank or file without attacking each other. So by the pigeonhole principle, all the ranks and all the files must be filled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The diagonals are also constraints, meaning we can only have at most one queen on them, but they are optional, since there are many more diagonals than there are queens to fill them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if we wanted to place knights on a board so they don't attack each other? Well, we could write the optional constraints for knights as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;    &lt;span class="n"&gt;knight_choices&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;j&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;  
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;knight&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;j&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;j&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;knight&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;j&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;j&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;knight&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;j&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;j&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;knight&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;j&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;j&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;knight&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;j&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;j&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;j&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;product&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;range&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;N&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;range&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;N&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The constraints consist of any pair of squares separated by a knight's move, and each square belongs to exactly eight such pairs. Again, these constraints are optional, because there are many more pairs of squares separated by a knight's move than there are knights you can place on the board. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of these constraints are optional, unfortunately Knuth's algorithm cannot be used on this puzzle without significant modification. As soon as there are only optional constraints remaining, Knuth's algorithm returns the partial solution it has constructed as a successful solution, meaning it would place no knights at all on the board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what about a Sudoku puzzle? Well, the traditional Sudoku puzzle represents very simply as an exact cover problem. Here are the traditional sudoku constraints from the &lt;code&gt;Sudoku.variant_sudoku&lt;/code&gt; module in my &lt;code&gt;Sudoku&lt;/code&gt; package:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;## Constraints for a traditional sudoku&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;_base_choices&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;j&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;k&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Traditional Sudoku constraints&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;position&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;j&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;row&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;k&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;column&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;j&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;k&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;box&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;//&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;N&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;N&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;j&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;//&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;N&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;k&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;N&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;j&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;k&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;zip&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;cycle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;N&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,)),&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;product&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;range&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;N&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;range&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;N&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;range&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;N&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)))&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The choice &lt;code&gt;(i, j, k)&lt;/code&gt; represents that the digit &lt;code&gt;k&lt;/code&gt; has been written into the cell &lt;code&gt;(i,j)&lt;/code&gt;. Each such choice satisfies constraints on its position, its row, column, and box. Also, only one digit can appear in a given box, so we also have a constraint for the cell itself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All these constraints must be satisfied, so we have the following list of required constraints:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;## The constraints for a traditional Sudoku which _must_ be satisfied&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;_must_con&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;[(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;position&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;j&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;j&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;product&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;range&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;N&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;range&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;N&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))]&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;row&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;n&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;product&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;range&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;N&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;range&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;N&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))]&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The variant sudoku cosntraints I'm interested are similar to the chess constraints above. The most popular is &lt;em&gt;anti-knight sudoku&lt;/em&gt;, however you can also get interesting variants by prohibiting the same digits from being separated by each other by a &lt;em&gt;King's move&lt;/em&gt;, and another interesting variant is to prohibit two consecutive digits from appearing adjacent to each other orthogonally. There are all optional constraints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the whole set of variant constraints from the &lt;code&gt;Sudoku.variant_sudoku&lt;/code&gt; module: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;## Variant sudoku constraints&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At its heart, the algorithm is a straightforward depth-first search, but which exploits the structure of a set multicover problem to efficiently eliminate branches of the search tree. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since we're leveraging the structure of the problem, it helps to put that structure into a class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A covering problem instance consists of a set of &lt;em&gt;constraints&lt;/em&gt; and a set of &lt;em&gt;choices&lt;/em&gt;. The constraints simply form an abstract set, with each &lt;em&gt;choice&lt;/em&gt; being a subset of the constraints. The intended interpretation is that a given choice &lt;em&gt;satisfies&lt;/em&gt; its &lt;em&gt;constraints&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of an exact cover problem is to pick a minimal set of choices to satisfy every constraint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To put things more concretely, we can take the same approach as Knuth and view the covering problem instance as a 2D matrix, where columns correspond to constraints and rows correspond to choices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enumerating the columns &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(c\)&lt;/span&gt; and rows &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(r\)&lt;/span&gt;, we get a matrix representation &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(A\)&lt;/span&gt; of the covering problem by placing a &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(1\)&lt;/span&gt; in &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(A(r, c)\)&lt;/span&gt; if choice &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(r\)&lt;/span&gt; belongs to constraint &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(c\)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;multiset multicover&lt;/em&gt; problem generalizes this in two ways: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The constraints are a &lt;em&gt;multiset&lt;/em&gt;, with the intended interpretation being that a constraint which appears with multiplicity should be satisfied with the same multiplicity. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The choices are multisets, with the intended interpretation being that a constraint appearing in a choice with multiplicity is satisfied by that choice with that multiplicity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Including just the first generalization gives a &lt;em&gt;set multicover&lt;/em&gt; problem, including the second gives a &lt;em&gt;multiset multicover&lt;/em&gt; problem. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A third generalization, which isn't required for traditional Sudoku but which is required for combinatorial puzzles like the &lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="math"&gt;\(n\)&lt;/span&gt; queens problem&lt;/em&gt; and which we'll require for our variant Sudoku module, is to allow for some constraints to be &lt;em&gt;optional&lt;/em&gt;: meaning that they can fail to be satisfied, but must not be satisfied more than the specified limit of times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our &lt;code&gt;SetMultiCover&lt;/code&gt; class will take as its argument a dictionary of &lt;code&gt;choices&lt;/code&gt;, where the keys are the choices and the corresponding values are sets of constraints satisfied by the choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;SetMultiCover&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="fm"&gt;__init__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;choices&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;initial_choices&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;multiplicities&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;None&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;must_satisfy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;None&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;For the dancing links aglorithm, we also need to operate along the &lt;em&gt;rows&lt;/em&gt;: given a constraint, we need to know all the choices which satisfy that constraint. Dancing links uses this to efficiently eliminate other choices from the search space once a constraint is satisfied. So we'll need to recover this &lt;em&gt;row-to-column&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;constraint-to-choices&lt;/em&gt;, representation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;        &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;choice_to_constraints&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;choices&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;constraint_to_choices&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;defaultdict&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;choice&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;choice_to_constraints&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;constraint&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;choice_to_constraints&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;choice&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]:&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;constraint_to_choices&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;constraint&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;choice&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;To accomodate the &lt;em&gt;multicover&lt;/em&gt; generalization, we need to keep counters of the number of times a constraint still needs to be satisfied (for each constraint, we'll decrement this value as we satisfy it). The &lt;em&gt;optional constraint&lt;/em&gt; generalization is easy, we simply keep separate counters for the required and the optional constraints. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make things simpler, when a list of required constraints &lt;em&gt;isn't&lt;/em&gt; provided, we revert to the regular set multicover problem where &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; constraints are required. This might seem a bit backwards, but it's the correct approach to take instead of requiring that a user who wnats a regular set multicover problem provide a redundant list of all the constraints. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;        &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Dump constraints into required/optional Counters&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;required_constraints&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Counter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;optional_constraints&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Counter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;must_satisfy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;required_constraints&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;update&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;must_satisfy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;optional_constraints&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;update&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="n"&gt;constraint&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;constraint&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;constraint_to_choices&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;keys&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Dictionary mapping constraint to which counter it belongs.&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;which_counter&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;dict&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;which_counter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;update&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;constraint&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;required_constraints&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;constraint&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;required_constraints&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;which_counter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;update&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;constraint&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;optional_constraints&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;As part of the implementation, we'll go ahead and build the solution by calling in to the private &lt;code&gt;_dancing_links&lt;/code&gt; solver we're about to write. To make things a bit more Pythonic, we'll be making the objects of this class into iterators, so we provide the standard iterator methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;        &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Initialize partial solution being constructed.&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;solution&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Dump in initial solutions and solve.&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;try&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;choice&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;initial_choices&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;_make_choice&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;choice&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;it&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;_dancing_links&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;except&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ne"&gt;KeyError&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# If we can&amp;#39;t make all the initial choices, puzzle is unsolveable.&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;it&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;iter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(())&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="fm"&gt;__iter__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="fm"&gt;__next__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;next&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;it&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Alright, now time to write the &lt;code&gt;_dancing_links&lt;/code&gt; method. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knuth's algorithm proceeds as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;1.&lt;/span&gt;  If the matrix A has no columns, the current partial
    solution is a valid solution; terminate successfully.

&lt;span class="k"&gt;2.&lt;/span&gt;  Otherwise choose a column c (deterministically).

&lt;span class="k"&gt;3.&lt;/span&gt;  Choose a row r such that A(r, c) = 1 (nondeterministically).

&lt;span class="k"&gt;4.&lt;/span&gt;  Include row r in the partial solution.

&lt;span class="k"&gt;5.&lt;/span&gt;  For each column j such that A(r, j) = 1,
        for each row i such that A(i, j) = 1,
            delete row i from matrix A.
        delete column j from matrix A.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;We execute a depth-first traversal on the search tree to
find all the solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only important optimization is Knuth's "S heuristic":&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;    When choosing a new unsatisfied column, we always pick
    the column with the fewest number of 1&amp;#39;s (constraint
    with the fewest number of choices).
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Once we've selected a column, we consider each choice of row in order and recurse down each of those branches of the search tree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because we are considering a multicover problem with multiplicity, this column may remain selected, meaning we'd have to make multiple choices of rows from this column. To eliminate branching over different orders of those choices we enforce an order on rows by Python's built in &lt;code&gt;id()&lt;/code&gt; serialization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;_dancing_links&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;selected_column&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;None&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;last_choice&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;None&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;not&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;required_constraints&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Matrix A has no columns, can yield the current partial&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# solution and terminate.&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="k"&gt;yield&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;solution&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;selected_column&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;required_constraints&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Still working on the same column, so only consider row&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# choices in order.&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="n"&gt;choices&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="n"&gt;choice&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;choice&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;constraint_to_choices&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;selected_column&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;choice&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;last_choice&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Need to select a new column. Pick the column according&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# to S heuristic.&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="n"&gt;constrained_column&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;min&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;required_constraints&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="n"&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;lambda&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;col&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;len&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;constraint_to_choices&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;col&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]),&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="n"&gt;choices&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;constraint_to_choices&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;constrained_column&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Recurse on each of the possile choices.&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;choice&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;choices&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;_make_choice&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;choice&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="k"&gt;yield from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;_dancing_links&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="n"&gt;selected_column&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;constrained_column&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;last_choice&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;choice&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;_backtrack&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;_make_choice&lt;/code&gt; method needs to do a lot of book-keeping: once we've decided to choose a column &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(j\)&lt;/span&gt;, we need to go through the column and look at every corresponding row &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(i\)&lt;/span&gt; where &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(A(i,j)=1\)&lt;/span&gt;. For each such row &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(i\)&lt;/span&gt;, if that constraint has now been already satisfied its limited number of times, we need to go through it and remove every other column (&lt;code&gt;other_choice&lt;/code&gt;) satisfying that constraint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;_make_choice&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;choice&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;solution&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;append&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;choice&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;constraint&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;choice_to_constraints&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;choice&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]:&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="n"&gt;counter&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;which_counter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;constraint&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="n"&gt;counter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;constraint&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;not&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;counter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;constraint&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]:&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="k"&gt;del&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;counter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;constraint&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;other_choice&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;constraint_to_choices&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;constraint&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]:&lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;other_constraint&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;choice_to_constraints&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;other_choice&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]:&lt;/span&gt;
                        &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;other_constraint&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;!=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;constraint&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
                            &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# WARNING: note we introduce an asymmetry&lt;/span&gt;
                            &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# between constraint_to_chocies and&lt;/span&gt;
                            &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# choices_to_constraint&lt;/span&gt;
                            &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;constraint_to_choices&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;other_constraint&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;remove&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
                                &lt;span class="n"&gt;other_choice&lt;/span&gt;
                            &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;One perhaps ugly feature we've commented on above is that as we apply this algorithm, we're only actually mutating the &lt;code&gt;constraint_to_choices&lt;/code&gt; dictionaries, so if you want to modify this algorithm yourself, keep in mind that these dictionaries don't remain symmetric once the algorithm starts running. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, this symmetry is essential to make it easy to backtrack during our depth-first-search, since we have all the information we need to recover in the &lt;code&gt;choice_to_constraints&lt;/code&gt; dictionary we haven't mutated:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;_backtrack&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;choice&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;solution&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;pop&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;constraint&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;choice_to_constraints&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;choice&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]:&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="n"&gt;counter&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;which_counter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;constraint&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;constraint&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;not&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;counter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# restore what we deleted from constraint_to_choices&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;other_choice&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;constraint_to_choices&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;constraint&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]:&lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;other_constraint&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;choice_to_constraints&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;other_choice&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]:&lt;/span&gt;
                        &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;other_constraint&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;!=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;constraint&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
                            &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;constraint_to_choices&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;other_constraint&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
                                &lt;span class="n"&gt;other_choice&lt;/span&gt;
                            &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="n"&gt;counter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;constraint&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;And that's the whole implementation. I'll show how to put it into action to solve variant sudokus and other puzzles in a future post. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this post, I'll demonstrate the variant sudoku library I wrote to produce those counts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The set &lt;code&gt;multicover&lt;/code&gt; module, with the dancing links implementation, and the &lt;code&gt;variant_sudoku&lt;/code&gt; module are all combined into a single Python package that I've called &lt;code&gt;sudoku&lt;/code&gt;. We can import the Sudoku class like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;sudoku&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Sudoku&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;You can also go ahead and import the &lt;code&gt;SetMultiCover&lt;/code&gt; class using relative imports, if you want to apply it to other combinatorial problems:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;sudoku.multicover&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;SetMultiCover&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;SMC&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Using the package is simple. The class by default accepts input sudoku puzzles formatted as 2D arrays of digits between &lt;code&gt;1-9&lt;/code&gt;, with &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; representing a blanks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Here&amp;#39;s a sample sudoku puzzle&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;grid&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;9&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;9&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;9&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;We can solve the puzzle by calling Sudoku() on it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;solutions&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Sudoku&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;grid&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Sudoku() returns a generator holding all the possible solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;solution&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;solutions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nb"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;----&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Solution:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;----&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nb"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;solution&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The Sudoku class implements a &lt;code&gt;__str__&lt;/code&gt; dunder method, so we'll get a nicely formatted printed output:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Output ... &lt;/summary&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;----
Solution:
----
&lt;span class="m"&gt;832157496&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="m"&gt;745396218&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="m"&gt;196284753&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="m"&gt;257831649&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="m"&gt;984672531&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="m"&gt;613549827&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="m"&gt;378415962&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="m"&gt;429763185&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="m"&gt;561928374&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can also explore variant sudokus. Let's start with a remarkably sparse sudoku board:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;grid&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only one given! This would have billions of solutions using
just the traditional sudoku ruleset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But variant constraints can make this fun! Let's use the king
and knight "chess sudoku" rules and add a consecutive rule:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;solutions&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Sudoku&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;grid&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;king&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;knight&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;consecutive&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Printing out and numbering all the solutions:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;index&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;solution&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;enumerate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;solutions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;9&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;,
&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;9&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sudoku package is built on a powerful set-multicover module
which uses Knuth's efficient algorithm X behind the scenes, you can use
it for all kinds of other combinatorial problems:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;n_queens_problem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;constraints&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;queen_on_position&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;j&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;queen_on_rank&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;queen_on_file&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;j&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;queen_on_backward_diag&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;j&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;n&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;queen_on_forward_diag&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;j&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;j&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;j&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;range&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;j&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;range&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)]&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;SMC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;constraints&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;must_satisfy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;r&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;r&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;queen_on_rank&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;queen_on_file&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;range&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)]&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class="n"&gt;N&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="sa"&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;----&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Found &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;sum&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;_&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;n_queens_problem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;N&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt; solutions to the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;N&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt; queens problem&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Output ... &lt;/summary&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;----
Found&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;92&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;solutions&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;to&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;the&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;queens&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;problem
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Try it yourself&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you'd like to play with the package yourself online without downloading the package, I've put it up &lt;a href="https://repl.it/@ethmcc1/variantSudokuSolver"&gt;on repl.it&lt;/a&gt; for your convenience. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind that although the package is &lt;em&gt;very fast&lt;/em&gt;, the spaces of various variant sudoku solutions are &lt;em&gt;enormous&lt;/em&gt;, so you could benefit from running the code on your local machine, or a faster cloud server if you have access to one!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's the approach I take. I'll assume you have &lt;code&gt;Homebrew&lt;/code&gt; installed on your system and are running &lt;code&gt;zsh&lt;/code&gt; for your shell. If you're in another shell, you'd at least have to replace the shell configuration file names as appropriate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Installing &lt;code&gt;pyenv&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;pyenv-virtualenv&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's how I use Homebrew to install &lt;code&gt;pyenv&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;pyenv-virtualenv&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;%&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;brew&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;install&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;pyenv&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;pyenv-virtualenv
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;To configure your shell to use &lt;code&gt;pyenv&lt;/code&gt; automatically as you navigate directories, you need to initialize both &lt;code&gt;pyenv&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;pyenv-virtualenv&lt;/code&gt; each time you start a shell. Here's how I configured my &lt;code&gt;.zshrc&lt;/code&gt; config file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;%&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;eval &amp;quot;$(pyenv init -)&amp;quot;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;~/.zshrc
%&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;eval &amp;quot;$(pyenv virtualenv-init -)&amp;quot;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;~/.zshrc
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Setting the global Python version&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You'll want to install the latest version of Python and set it as your global Python installation. When I wrote this, the latest Python stable release was 3.8.3:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;pyenv&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;install&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;3.8.3&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
pyenv&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;global&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;3.8.3&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Creating a new &lt;code&gt;pyenv&lt;/code&gt; virtual environment&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To create a new virtual environment, use the following syntax:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;%&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;pyenv&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;virtualenv&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;$(&lt;/span&gt;version&lt;span class="k"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;$(&lt;/span&gt;venv_name&lt;span class="k"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The version parameter is optional, if ommitted &lt;code&gt;pyenv&lt;/code&gt; will use the global version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Setting the virtual environment for a directory&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To set the virtual environment to be used in a particular directory, simply run:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;%&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;pyenv&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;local&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;$(&lt;/span&gt;venv_name&lt;span class="k"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This command will create a &lt;code&gt;.python-version&lt;/code&gt; file in your current working directory containing the name of the virtual environment to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're using GitHub on a solo project, consider &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; instinctively putting &lt;code&gt;.python-version&lt;/code&gt; in your &lt;code&gt;.gitignore&lt;/code&gt; file. It won't work for collaborators, who will still have to install your project requirements from a &lt;code&gt;pip&lt;/code&gt; frozen &lt;code&gt;requirements.txt&lt;/code&gt; file or some other setup script, but as long as your environment is still available on your machine, cloning the repository with the &lt;code&gt;.python-version&lt;/code&gt; file already set up will make your own workflow easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Cleaning up a Python installation.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your default Python installation may have gotten ugly if you haven't been using &lt;code&gt;pyenv&lt;/code&gt; appropriately. This following shell command can help:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;%&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;pip&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;uninstall&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;-y&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;-r&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;pip&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;freeze&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Using pyenv to manage PATH priority.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What about your global Python? I like to keep my system installation of python clean for macOS to use, and I like to automatically use the latest stable version of Python 3 in all my directories where I haven't set a virtual environment, which I also like to keep clean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For my virtual environments, for production I like to use specific projects for specific environments, that way I can dump a &lt;code&gt;pip&lt;/code&gt; freeze file with minimal fuss to distribute a Python project. However, when hacking around I keep various toolsets. One for &lt;code&gt;django&lt;/code&gt; projects, one for &lt;code&gt;flask&lt;/code&gt; projects, one with &lt;code&gt;numpy&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;pandas&lt;/code&gt;, one with &lt;code&gt;Pelican&lt;/code&gt; (that I use to develop this website you're on now).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want these various tools to be available to you in your day-to-day work flow outside of project environments, you can set your &lt;code&gt;global&lt;/code&gt; environment to &lt;em&gt;multiple&lt;/em&gt; &lt;code&gt;pyenv&lt;/code&gt; environments like so:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;%&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;pyenv&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;global&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;.8.3&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;numpy&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;pandas&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;flask&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;pelican&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;django&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;misc-tools&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;system
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;When calling for Python modules, &lt;code&gt;pyenv&lt;/code&gt; will look in the directories for these virtual environments in the order you've specified.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="programming"></category><category term="development"></category><category term="environments"></category><category term="python"></category></entry><entry><title>On Miracle Sudoku</title><link href="https://ethmcc.github.io/miracle-sudoku" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-05-11T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2020-05-11T00:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Ethan McCarthy</name></author><id>tag:ethmcc.github.io,2020-05-11:/miracle-sudoku</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The Miracle Sudoku was introduced by Mitchell Lee,

&lt;p&gt;Sudoku and Chess …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The Miracle Sudoku was introduced by Mitchell Lee, 
who gave a board containing only two given digits, a 1 and a 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was introduced to this Sudoku variant (and Lee’s board) by 
Simon Anthony of Cracking the Cryptic: &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yKf9aUIxdb4" rel="external"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yKf9aUIxdb4&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sudoku and Chess Sudoku constraints are purely combinatorial, 
meaning a board with fewer than 8 given digits cannot be uniquely solvable. 
The consecutive constraint, however, allows for a dramatic reduction in the number of given digits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to explore solutions to Miracle Sudoku by viewing them as an &lt;em&gt;exact cover&lt;/em&gt; problem, 
solved in Python using Donald Knuth’s &lt;em&gt;“dancing links”&lt;/em&gt; implementation of Algorithm X. 
I hope to write up my implementation in a future programming post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Rules of the game:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Miracle Sudoku is a variant Sudoku with the following additional constraints:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Two “Chess Sudoku” constraints:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cells which are separated by a Chess King’s move cannot contain the same digit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cells which are separated by a Chess Knight’s move cannot contain the same digit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A consecutive constraint:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No two orthogonally adjacent cells may contain consecutive digits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any fully-filled Sudoku board can be rotated or reflected to obtain another fully-filled Sudoku board, 
logically equivalent to the original. 
It is not hard to see that each fully-filled Miracle Sudoku board corresponds 
to a full set of 8 distinct equivalent versions of itself via such dihedral symmetries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a variant Sudoku with a purely combinatorial ruleset, 
any of the 9!=326,880 permutations of the label set preserves the ruleset, 
but there is only one permutation of the labels on a Miracle Sudoku which
will preserves the adjacency constraint: inverting the labels of the 
digits 1 through 9 (relabelling each 9 as a 1, 8 as a 2, etc).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Theorems:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are exactly 72 fully-filled Miracle Sudoku boards.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are a total of 72/8 = 9 essentially unique fully-filled Miracle Sudoku boards up to rotations and mirroring, one for each choice of the center digit as 1 through 9.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Including both mirroring and inverting the labels 1 through 9, there are only 5 essentially unique fully-filled Miracle Sudoku boards, one for each choice of the center digit as 1 through 5.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any fully-filled Miracle Sudoku board can be obtained as the unique solution to a Miracle Sudoku puzzle with only two givens.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is no uniquely-solvable Miracle Sudoku puzzle with only one given.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In fact, the givens in any uniquely solvable Miracle Sudoku puzzle must bear at least two distinct numerals (in distinct rows and columns).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are 174,816 ways to set two givens such that the resulting Miracle Sudoku puzzle is uniquely solvable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This gives 174,816/8 = 21,852 essentially unique Miracle Sudoku puzzles bearing two givens (although many of these will quickly converge on each other when solving).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A random choice of two distinct givens will result in a valid, uniquely solvable Miracle Sudoku puzzle just under 75% of the time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A table of the 5 essentially unique Miracle Sudoku solutions is presented below, along with a table of all the full 72.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve included a table below of the five essentially-unique 
Miracle Sudoku boards up to dihedral symmetries and relabeling. 
You can spot some remarkable symetries in the layout of digits.&lt;/p&gt;
